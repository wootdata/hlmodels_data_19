Ironman 1.0, 1.0b

This is 2 skins based on The gordon model
(I have to learn 3d studio) Its basicly the
first ironman is created by me from hand
the second one (War machine)is cut piece by
 piece from a picture I found while browsing. 
I was tired of seeing users wait for the skin
to be made by someone else, personelly, I dont
follow the ironman series. But I Try to make a
skin for everybody.

to install create 2  (yes 2 dirs) called ironman1 and ironman2 in 
your player dir.  then copy the indivisual files into each, and 
have fun.
